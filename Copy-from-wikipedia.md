[George Griffith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Griffith) (1857–1906) was a British writer. He was active mainly in the [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction) genre, writing many [future-war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_literature) stories and helping to shape that emerging subgenre. He was briefly the leading science fiction author in Britain, making his breakthrough with his debut novel [The Angel of the Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Angel_of_the_Revolution) (1893), which was first serialized in [Pearson's Weekly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson%27s_Weekly). He followed it up with the likewise successful sequel [Olga Romanoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olga_Romanoff) (1894). Griffith was highly active as a writer throughout the 1890s, penning many short works for [C. Arthur Pearson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Arthur_Pearson,_1st_Baronet), and went on travel assignments. These included an 1896 trip to [Southern Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Africa) that resulted in Griffith writing the novel Briton or Boer? (1897), anticipating the [Boer War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Boer_War) (1899–1902). Griffith's career declined in the late 1890s, and he was surpassed by [H. G. Wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells) in the eyes of Pearson and the reading public. His last outright success was [A Honeymoon in Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Honeymoon_in_Space) (1901). He continued to write prolifically up until his death at the age of 48.
